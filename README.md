## Overview

This repository contains a simulation of the human cardiopulmonary system developed using [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://mtk.sciml.ai/stable/) in Julia. The model includes:

- Cardiovascular model
    - Four chamber heart
    - Dynamic valves (Mynard)
    - Arterial and venous system (including nonlinear pressure-volume relationship in large veins and vascular collapse mechanics)
    - 6 branches (head/brain, upper body, coronary, renal, splanchnic, lower body) with hydrostatic dependence
    - External tissue pressure
    - Hydrostatically dependent pulmonary circulation based on zonal flow through the lungs
- Pulmonary model
    - Four chamber lung model
    - Dynamic pleural pressure based on breathing rhythm
- Gas exchange
    - Lung and tissue oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange
- Respiratory control
    - Peripheral chemoreceptors
    - Central chemoreceptors
- Cardiovascular control
    - Arterial baroreflex
    - Cardiopulmonary reflex
    - Pulmonary stretch reflex
    - Peripheral chemoreceptors
    - CNS Ischemic Response
    - Cerebral, coronary, and muscular autoregulation

## Simulation Scenarios

The model supports simulation of:

- Tilt-angle protocols
- Altered-gravity environments
- Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) protocols
