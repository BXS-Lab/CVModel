This model is a simulation of the human cardiovascular system, including a four chamber heart, arteries, veins, and microcirculation. It includes reflex control for the arterial baroreflex (ABR) and cardiopulmonary reflex (CPR), as well as hydrostatic effects, interstitial fluid flow, and external tissue pressures. The model is designed to simulate various physiological scenarios, including a tilt angle protocol, altered-gravity environment, and lower body negative pressure (LBNP) protocol. The underlying equations are based on the work of Heldt (2004), Zamanian (2007), Diaz Artiles (2015), and Whittle (2023). The model is implemented using the ModelingToolkit.jl package in Julia.
